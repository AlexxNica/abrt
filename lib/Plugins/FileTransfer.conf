# Configuration of the FileTransfer reporter plugin.

# The plugin is invoked in the abrt.conf file, usually in the
# ActionsAndReporters option and/or the [cron] section.
# There are two modes of invocation:
#
# * Specify FileTransfer(one) in ActionsAndReporters directive.
# Immediately after crash is detected, the plugin transfers
# crash data to the server specified via URL directive in this file.
#
# * Specify FileTransfer(store) in ActionsAndReporters directive
# and add "HH:MM = FileTransfer" line in [cron] section.
# At the time of the crash, the plugin stores a record of it
# in its internal list. When specified time is reached,
# the plugin iterates through its internal list and sends
# every recorded crash to the specified URL.
# After that, the internal list is cleared.


# URL to upload the files to
# supported: ftp, ftps, http, https, scp, sftp, tftp, file
# for example: ftp://user:password@server.name/directory
# or:          scp://user:password@server.name:port/directory etc.
# for testing: file:///tmp/test_directory
