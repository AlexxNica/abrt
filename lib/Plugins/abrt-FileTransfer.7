.SH NAME
FileTransfer plugin for abrt(8)
.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
.I abrt
is a daemon that watches for application crashes. When a crash occurs,
it collects the crash data and takes action according to 
its configuration. This manual page describes the \fIFileTransfer\fP plugin 
for \fIabrt\fP.
.P
This plugin is used to transfer the crash report to another
machine using a file transfer protocol. The protocols supported
are FTP, FTPS, HTTP, HTTPS, SCP, SFTP, and TFTP. 
.SH INVOCATION
.P
The plugin is invoked in the \fIabrt.conf\fP file, usually in the
\fIActionsAndReporters\fP option and/or the \fI[cron]\fP section.
There are two modes of invocation: 
.P
* If you use the parameter
\fI"store"\fP, the plugin stores a record of the occurrence of
the crash in its internal list.
.P
* If you use some other parameter, or no parameter at all, the
plugin will iterate through the internal list and will send
every recorded crash to the server specified in the \fIFileTransfer.conf\fP
configuration file. After that, the internal list is cleared.
.P
On a production machine, you probably do not want the daemon to send crash 
data at times that the machine is busy working. This second mode allows you
to send crash reports at a quieter time (at night, perhaps) that you 
schedule in the \fI[cron]\fP section of \fIabrt.conf\fP.
.SH CONFIGURATION
The \fIFileTransfer.conf\fP configuration file contains 
several entries in the format "Option = Value". The options are:
.SS URL
The URL of the server, where the crash should
be transfered, specifying the protocol, the path,
the user name and the password, for example:
.br
URL = ftp://user:passwd@server.com/path
.SS ArchiveType
The type of the archive in which to pack the crash data. 
Currently, \fI.tar.gz\fP, \fI.tar.bz2\fP and \fI.zip\fP are supported.
The plugin currently relies on external file archiving
commandline utilities, which will create the archive.
The default is
.br
ArchiveType = .tar.gz
.SS RetryCount
This specifies how many times the plugin will try to resend
the file if the transfer was not succesful. The plugin
waits a while before it retries the transfer: see \fIRetryDelay\fP
The default is
.br
RetryCount = 3
.SS RetryDelay
If the transfer was not succesful, the plugin will
wait some time before sending the file again. This configuration
option specifies the time in seconds. The default is
.br
RetryDelay = 20
.SH EXAMPLES
.P
Typical configuration in \fIabrt.conf\fP. The crash is stored
each time it happens and at midnight, all the crash data
is transferred to a central server.
