This test is checking whether /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern is truncated
by the kernel (when passed to the handler)
when we use pattern which is long enough (but supported according to the documentation).

core_pattern_pipe_test.c is single purpose "handler" which will save its arguments to
core.info file, so we can check whether all of the parameters in core_pattern were
passed to our "handler".
