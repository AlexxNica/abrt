This test first builds tests of GDB which contains bigcore.exp, which is using big sparse coredumps,
which were affected by running abrtd.

First it computes time to run the GDB test with abrtd stopped, then with abrtd running.
At the end, the test compares measured run times to see whether abrtd is affecting sparse cores.
