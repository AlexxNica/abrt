Test is using conf_* configuration files to test different path blacklisting options.

In each of it, /usr is blacklisted differently. After replacing the configuration
file, two processes are crashed - sleep, which is located in /bin/ and yes which
is located in /usr/bin/. First should be caught, second skipped.

WARNING: This might stop working in Fedora 17 due to /usr move and $PATH changes
