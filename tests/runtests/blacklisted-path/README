Test is using conf_* configuration files to test different path blacklisting options.

In each of it, /usr is blacklisted differently. After replacing the configuration
file, two processes are crashed - will_segfault, which is located in /usr/bin/ and /var/will_abort.
First should be skipped, second caught.
