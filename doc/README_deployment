Install publican.
Version 3.0.0 was used by me via manual fetch from koji + yum localinstall.
Docs are in /usr/share/doc/publican-doc-3.0.0/en-US/index.html
if you opted to install publican-doc-3.0.0.
Ask jhradilek, msvoboda for help.

publican create --name deployment
(creates "deployment" directory and some files in it)

Copy Automatic_Bug_Reporting_Tool_ABRT.xml to deployment/en-US/
Copy abrt-*.png to deployment/en-US/images/
(took these files from RHEL6 Deployment Guide)

Add
	<xi:include href="Automatic_Bug_Reporting_Tool_ABRT.xml" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" />
to deployment/en-US/deployment.xml file.
(You may want to remove some auto-generated files there?)

publican build --langs en-US --formats html-single
(must be in the "deployment" dir (one with "publican.cfg" file))

firefox deployment/tmp/en-US/html-single/index.html

tmp/* stuff seems to be temporary and ok to nuke
