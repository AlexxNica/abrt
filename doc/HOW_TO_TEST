How to test before releasing new update:

I. Build and install
===================
a) build the packages as scratch in koji
b) download and install (the best is to create a local repo and try to install it using yum)
c) start the daemon and check logs for any sign of a problem

II. Crash detection
=====================
    == 1. Default crash detection ==
    a) kill some C/C++ app with kill -9 and watch if it's detected by abrt
    b) edit some packaged python script to raise an exception and watch is abrt
       detects it
    c) use our saved kerneloopses and test detection of oopses
    
    == 2. Advanced crash detection ==
    a) crash some app that comes from unsigned package - abrt should ignore it
    b) disable the gpg chcek and try repeat step a) - abrt shouldn't ignore it

III. Reporting
=============
    == 1. Reporting to bugzilla ==
    a) try to report some crash to bz using gui 
        - gui should ask for login+pass
        - crash should be reported  after filling the right credentials
    b) try to report using gui without gnome-keyring
        - gui should ask for login+pass
        - crash should be reported  after filling the right credentials
        - login+pass won't be saved
    c) try to report every supported crash abrt detects C/C++, oops, python script
    d) repeat this with cli
