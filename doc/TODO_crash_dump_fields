        Planned changes to crash_data and dump_dir structures

    Time field(s)

Need to add CD_FLAG_UNIXTIME bit for struct crash_item's flags field.
It should be set on cd["time"] item when we do

    cd = call create_crash_data_from_dump_dir(dd);

Note that later we may add other elements beside "time" which contain
unix time.

Need to add a function which formats time elements for printing.
Something like this:

const char *printable_form_of_crash_item(const char *content, unsigned flags);

For most fields it should return them as-is, for CD_FLAG_UNIXTIME
fields it should return malloced "YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss" string.

Later, if/when we will get more CD_FLAG_FOO flags, some of them also
may need special formatting, and this function can deal with them too.

[Implementation note: use the following trick to avoid needing to return
malloced data (which isn't convenient for caller, it needs to free it):

printable_form_of_crash_item(...)
{
    ...
    if (need to use malloced string)
    {
        s = malloc_and_format_string();

        static unsigned malloced_idx = 0;
        static char *malloced_vec[8];

        malloced_idx = (malloced_idx+1) % 8;
        free(malloced_vec[malloced_idx]);
        malloced_vec[malloced_idx] = s;
    }
    else
        s = some_non_malloced_string;
    ...
    return s;
}
]

dd_load_text_ext(dd, "time", flags) may benefit from a new flag DD_LOAD_TEXT_PRINTABLE,
which makes it generate printable representation of fields.
