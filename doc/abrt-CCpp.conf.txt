NAME

abrt-CCpp.conf - Configuration file for ABRT's core dump crash hook

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The configuration file consists of items in the format "Option = Value".
Ithe following items are recognized:

MakeCompatCore = 'yes' / 'no' ...::
   CCpp hook writes its template to the "/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern" file
   and stores the original template in the "/var/run/abrt/saved_core_pattern"
   file. If you want CCpp hook to create a core dump file named according to
   the original template as well, set 'MakeCompatCore' to 'yes'.
   If the original template string starts with "|", the string "core" is used
   instead of the template.
   For more information about naming core dump files see 'man 5 core'.

MaxCoreFileSize = 'a number in MiB' ...::
   This configuration option together with MaxCrashReportsSize set the limit on
   the size of dumped core file. The lower value of the both options is used as
   the effective limit. 0 is evaluated as unlimited for the both options.

SaveBinaryImage = 'yes' / 'no' ...::
   Do you want a copy of crashed binary be saved?
   Useful, for example, when _deleted binary_ segfaults.
   Default is 'no'.

IgnoredPaths = /path/to/ignore/*, */another/ignored/path* ...::
   ABRT will ignore crashes in executables whose absolute path matches
   any of the glob patterns listed in the comma separated list.

AllowedUsers = root, wheel, ...::
   ABRT will process only crashes of either allowed users 'AllowedUsers' or
   users who are members of allowed group 'AllowedGroups'. If no allowed users
   nor allowed group are specified ABRT will process crashes of all users.
   'AllowedUsers' is a comma separated list.

AllowedGroups = root, wheel, ...::
   ABRT will process only crashes of either allowed users 'AllowedUsers' or
   users who are members of allowed group 'AllowedGroups'. If no allowed users
   nor allowed group are specified ABRT will process crashes of all users.
   'AllowedGroups' is a comma separated list.

DebuginfoLocation = /var/cache/abrt-di::
   A colon separated list of file system paths that specify directories where
   ABRT should look for non-system debuginfos.
   The first path in the list is used by ABRT to save downloaded debuginfos.
   Therefore the first path in the list must be writable. The rest of the list
   can be read-only.

VerboseLog = NUM::
   Used to make the hook more verbose
