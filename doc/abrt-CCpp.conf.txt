abrt-CCpp.conf - Configuration file for ABRT's core dump crash hook

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The configuration file consists of items in the format "Option = Value".
Ithe following items are recognized:

MakeCompatCore = 'yes' / 'no' ...::
   If you also want to dump file named "core"
   in crashed process' current dir, set to "yes".

SaveBinaryImage = 'yes' / 'no' ...::
   Do you want a copy of crashed binary be saved?
   Useful, for example, when _deleted binary_ segfaults.
   Default is 'no'.

CreateCoreBacktrace = 'yes' / 'no' ...::
   When this option is set to 'yes', core backtrace is generated
   from the memory image of the crashing process. Only the crash
   thread is present in the backtrace. This feature requires
   kernel 3.18 or newer, otherwise the core backtrace is not
   created.
   Default is 'yes'.

SaveFullCore = 'yes' / 'no' ...::
   Save full coredump? If set to 'no', coredump won't be saved
   and you won't be able to report the crash to Bugzilla. Only
   useful with 'CreateCoreBacktrace' set to 'yes'. Please
   note that if this option is set to 'no' and MakeCompatCore
   is set to 'yes', the core is still written to the current
   directory.
   Default is 'yes'.

VerboseLog = NUM::
   Used to make the hook more verbose
