============

NAME
----
abrt.conf - Configuration file for abrt.

DESCRIPTION
-----------
'abrt' is a daemon that watches for application crashes. When a crash occurs, it
collects the problem data and takes action according to its configuration. This
document describes abrt's configuration file.

The configuration file consists of items in the format "Option = Value".
A description of each item follows:

OpenGPGCheck = 'yes' | 'no'::
   When set to 'yes', 'abrt' will report crashes only in GPG signed packages.
   When set to 'no', it will report crashes also in unsigned packages. The
   default is 'no'.
OpenGPGPublicKeys = 'filename', 'filename' ...::
   These are the trusted GPG keys with which packages have to be
   signed for 'abrt' to report them if OpenGPGCheck = 'yes'.
BlackList = 'packageName', 'packageName' ...::
   'abrt' will ignore packages in this list and will not handle their crashes.
BlackListedPaths = '`/path/to/ignore/*`', '`*/another/ignored/path*`' ...::
   'abrt' will ignore crashes in executables whose absolute path matches
   one of specified patterns.
MaxCrashReportsSize = 'number'::
   The maximum disk space (specified in megabytes) that 'abrt'
   will use for all the crash dumps. Specify a value here to ensure
   that the crash dumps will not fill all available storage space.
   The default is 1000.
ProcessUnpackaged = 'yes' | 'no'::
   When set to 'yes', 'abrt' will catch all crashes in the system.
   When set to 'no', it will catch crashes only in Fedora packages.
   The default is 'no'.
