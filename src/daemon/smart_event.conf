# Access to /dev/sda usually requires root.
# skdump is usually in /usr/sbin.
# Therefore we run it as post-create event, thus: under root.
#
# The code is identical for all three packages.
#
# To be moved to the packages, so that it is (de)installed
# together with these packages.

# FIXME: not working yet, because program selection code
# looks at dump dir BEFORE running programs,
# thus, component is not created yet
# (it is created by 1st program in main .conf file)
# when program selection code looks at this file.
