abrt-action-buzilla(1)
====================

NAME
----
abrt-action-bugzilla - Reports problem to Bugzilla.

SYNOPSIS
--------
'abrt-action-bugzilla' [-v] [-c CONFFILE] -d DIR

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The tool reads problem dump directory DIR. Then it logs in to Bugzilla
and tries to find a bug with the same abrt_hash:HEXSTRING in 'Whiteboard'.

If such bug is not found, then a new bug is created. Elements of DIR
are stored in the bug as part of bug description or as attachments,
depending on their type and size.

Otherwise, if such bug is found and it is marked as CLOSED DUPLICATE,
the tool follows the chain of duplicates until it finds a non-DUPLICATE bug.
The tool adds a new comment to found bug.

The URL to new or modified bug is printed to stdout and recorded in
'reported_to' element in DIR.
