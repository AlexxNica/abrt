.SH NAME
abrt\-backtrace \- a backtrace analyzer for abrt
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B abrt\-backtrace
[option]... [FILE]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I abrt\-backtrace
is a command line tool that analyzes backtraces produced by
GDB and provides their textual representation useful for
crash duplication detection.

By default, abrt\-backtrace prints the backtrace tree created by
parsing the input file.

.SH OPTIONS
.B Basic startup options
.IP "\-V, \-\-version"
Displays version of abrt\-backtrace.
.IP "\-?, \-\-help"
Print a help message describing all of abrt-backtraceâ€™s command-line options.

.PP
.B Actions
.IP "\-i, \-\-independent"
Prints independent backtrace fallback. The "independent backtrace"
is used as a fallback internal representation of backtrace
when the internal parser fails to process the input due to
unsupported format.

.PP
.B Various options
.IP "\-n, \-\-single\-thread"
Removes all threads except the one that caused the crash from
the internal representation of the backtrace.
.IP "\-d=N, \-\-frame\-depth=N"
Display only the top N frames in every thread.
Frames that are a part of system error handling do not count to the N.
So more than N frames can be displayed, but N of them are useful for examination.
N must be larger than 1.
.IP "\-r, \-\-remove\-exit\-handlers"
Do not display exit handlers and frames that comes after them in the backtrace.
.IP "\-m, \-\-remove\-noncrash\-frames"
Do not display frames known as not causing the crash, but which are a common 
part of backtraces.
.IP "\-a, \-\-rate"
Print backtrace rating from 0 to 4.
.IP "\-c, \-\-crash\-function"
Print crash function if it's successfully detected.
.IP "\-p, \-\-debug\-parser"
Prints debug information when parsing the backtrace.
.IP "\-s, \-\-debug\-scanner"
Prints debug information when scanning the input file for the parser.
